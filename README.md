Few places in Delhi are as popular as the intersection of the historic Red Fort and the Chandni Chowk market.

According to the city police, it was close to this crowded intersection that at 18:52pm local time (13:22 GMT) an explosion in a "slow moving vehicle" caused multiple deaths and injuries.

Multiple government agencies are at the site which has been cordoned off. As I type, a specialist bomb disposal unit is arriving at the site.

Since the police had closed off the highway, I walked for over a kilometre to reach the site. The entire road was deserted with an occasional person shouting, warning me to not go ahead.

The wreckage was stark: mangled vehicles and scattered debris, evidence of an explosion powerful enough to be felt across a wide area.
